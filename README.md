# TDD React Native App
This is the second part of a two part tutorial.  In the [first tutorial](https://github.com/pairing4good/tdd-amplify-react) we created a React Notes App that uses an AWS Amplify backend to secure and store notes.  In this tutorial we will hook up a [native](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app#Native_app) mobile app that will use the same backend service that we built in the first tutorial.

## Prerequisites
- Complete the [first tutorial](https://github.com/pairing4good/tdd-amplify-react) before you start this tutorial.
